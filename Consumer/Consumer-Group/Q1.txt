We would like to be in an at-most once consuming scenario. Which offset commit strategy would you recommend?
1. commit the offsets in kafka ,before processing the data.
2. commit the offsets in kafka ,after processing the data.
3. commit the offsets on disk ,after processing the data.
4. Do not commit any offset and read from the beginning.
