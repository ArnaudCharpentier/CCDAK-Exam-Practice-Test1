Explanation
In case the consumer has the wrong leader of a partition, it will issue a metadata request.
The Metadata request can be handled by any node, 
so clients know afterwards which broker are the designated leader for the topic partitions. 
Produce and consume requests can only be sent to the node hosting partition leader.
