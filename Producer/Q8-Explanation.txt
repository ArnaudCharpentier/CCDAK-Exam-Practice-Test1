Explanation
Some messages may require multiple retries. If there are more than 1 requests in flight, it may result in messages received out of order.
Note an exception to this rule is if you enable the producer setting: enable.idempotence=true 
which takes care of the out of ordering case on its own. See: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-5494
