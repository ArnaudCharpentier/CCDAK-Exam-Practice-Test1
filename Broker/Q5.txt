You have a Kafka cluster and all the topics have a replication factor of 3. 
One intern at your company stopped a broker, and accidentally deleted all the data of that broker on the disk.
What will happen if the broker is restarted?

1. The broker will crash.
2. The broker will start, and other topic will also be deleted.
3. The broker will start, and won't be online untill all the data it needs to have is replicated from other leaders.
4. The broker will start, and won't have any data.
